A young woman's body
falls limp as some
figure steps away
from her. A man
races towards the
figure from behind
you,
nearly running into
you as he passes.


Raising his hands to
the heavens he speaks
several words 
in a foreign tongue
and a white light
emanates from 
his palms and seem
to pierce through
the dark figure, 
temporarily stunning
it. You feel the
hairs on the back of

your neck raise as
the figure reaches
out to the man
quickly
advancing on him,
lets out a violent
scream that shatters

the unusally silent
night and viciously
attacks the man.


Your presence does
not go unnoticed and
the dark figure 
begins to move
towards you. You
feel as if in a
trance;
Unable to move, you
feel the figure
staring at you, his
dark gaze seems to
have power over
you.

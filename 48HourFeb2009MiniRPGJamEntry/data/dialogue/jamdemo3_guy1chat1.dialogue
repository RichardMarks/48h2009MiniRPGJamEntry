Unknown Guy:
Hey! You! Yeah, you!
Did you see that hole
in the city wall?
I wonder what it was
that made that
hole....

I saw some kids run
through there a
little while ago.
You should be
careful. The guards
are patrolling the
city walls.
They do not take
kindly to intruders
wandering around the
royal city!
